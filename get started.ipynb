    "## 1- Challenge Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bioindicators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally occurring Bioindicators are used to assess the health of the environment and are also an important tool for detecting changes in the environment, either positive or negative, and their subsequent effects on human society. There are a certain factors which govern the presence of Bioindicators in environment such as transmission of light, water, temperature, and suspended solids. Through the application of Bioindicators we can predict the natural state of a certain region or the level/degree of contamination. The advantages associated with using Bioindicators are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Biological impacts can be determined.\n",
    "- To monitor synergetic and antagonistic impacts of various pollutants on a creature.\n",
    "- Early stage diagnosis as well as harmful effects of toxins to plants, as well as human beings, can be monitored.\n",
    "- Can be easily counted, due to their prevalence.\n",
    "- Economically viable alternative when compared with other specialized measuring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Utilization of Bioindicators\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression ‘Bioindicator’ is used as an aggregate term referring to all sources of biotic and abiotic reactions to ecological changes. Instead of simply working as gauges of natural change, taxa are utilized to show the impacts of natural surrounding changes, or environmental change. They are used to detect changes in natural surroundings as well as to indicate negative or positive impacts. They can also detect changes in the environment due to the presence of pollutants which can affect the biodiversity of the environment, as well as species present in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The condition of the environment is effectively monitored by the use of Bioindicator species due to their resistance to ecological variability. Hasselbach et al. utilized the moss i.e. Hylocomium splendens as a natural indicator of heavy metals in the remote tundra environment of northwestern Alaska. Here, the ore of mineral is mined from Red Dog Mine, the world’s largest creator of zinc (Zn), and is carried to a singular street (∼75 km long) to storage spaces on the Chukchi Sea. Hasselbach and her partners inspected whether this overland transport was influencing the encompassing physical biota. The contents of heavy metals inside the moss tissue were analyzed at different distances from the street. The concentrations of metals in moss tissue were most prominently adjacent to the haul street and reduced with distance, therefore supporting the theory that overland transport was in fact modifying the encompassing environment. In this study, lichens were utilized as biomonitors by utilizing the quantitative estimation of metal concentrations inside individual lichen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural, biological, and biodiversity markers can be found in various organisms occupying different types of environments. Lichens (a symbiosis among Cyano bacteria, algae, and/or fungi) and Bryophytes (liverworts) are frequently used to monitor air contamination. Both, Lichens and Bryophytes are powerful Bioindicators of air quality on the grounds that they have no roots, no fingernail skin, and acquire all their supplements from immediate introduction to the climate. Their high surface region to volume ratio further supports the theory of their use as a bioindicator, or supports their ability to capture contaminates from the air. Cynophyta, a type of phytoplankton, is one particularly powerful bioindicator which is known to indicate rapid eutrophication of water bodies such as reservoirs, lakes, etc. via the creation of bloom formations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biomonitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Bio-organisms are basically used to define the characteristics of a biosphere. These organisms are known as Bioindicators or biomonitors, both of which may vary considerably. When studying the environment the quality of changes taking place can be determined by Bioindicators while biomonitors are used to get quantitative information on the quality of the environment biological monitoring also incorporating data regarding past aggravations and the impacts of various variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring can be done for various biological processes or systems with the objective of observing the temporal and spatial changes in health status, assessing the impacts of specific environment or anthropogenic stressors and assessing the viability of anthropogenic measures (e.g. reclamation, remediation, and reintroduction). The species diversity is used as a prime aspect in biological monitoring, which is considered to be a valuable parameter in determining the health of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biomonitoring is one of the essential components for assessing the quality of water and has become an integral element of conducting studies on water pollution. Biomonitors are freely available all around the world. They fundamentally mirror the natural impact over creatures and can be used and understood with minimum preparation and training. Despite the fact that all natural species can be considered biomonitors to some degree, the above focal points applies well to planktons and similar species type, when water pollution is considered.\n",

    "### Plankton\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In many water bodies, such as, seas, lakes, streams, and swamps, significant biological production is carried out by plankton. Planktons are composed of organisms with chlorophyll (i.e. phytoplankton and animals such as zooplanktons). These planktons consist of communities that float along currents and tides, yet they fuse and cycle important quantities of energy that is then passed on to higher trophic levels (Walsh 1978).\n",
    "\n",
    "Planktons react rapidly to ecological changes and are viewed as excellent indicators of water quality and trophic conditions due to their short time and rapid rate of reproduction. Under natural conditions, the occurrence of planktonic organisms is identified with the resistance range in relation to abiotic ecological components (Temperature, Oxygen fixation, and pH) as well as the biotic connections among organisms. The changes that occur within the communities of planktons provide the platform to determine the trophic state of water bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "![need](https://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/3978/media/Plankton-Diagram3-lg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Planktons as an indicator of water pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "Since planktons are profoundly sensitive to natural change they are best markers of water quality and particularly sea conditions. One of the reasons planktons are being considered in seas is to monitor the water quality of the lake when there are high centralizations of phosphorus and nitrogen; these centralizations may be indicated by certain planktons reproducing at an increased rate. This is evidence of poor water quality that may influence other organisms living in the water body. In addition to being a health indicator, planktons are also the fundamental sustenance for many larger organisms in the sea. Thus the plankton is key to the marine organisms, as both an indicator of water quality and as the main food source for many fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plankton also plays an important role in biological deterioration organic matter; but if plankton populations are too large this creates other problems in managing the water body. Fish at this critical stage of ecological process play an important role by grazing the planktons. The two roles played by fish are very crucial as they help in maintaining the proper balance of planktons in the pond and convert the nutrient available in wastewater into a form which is consumable by humans. Additionally, certain planktons such as cyanobacteria produce toxins which are harmful for fish growth. Thus planktons can be termed as useful or harmful, with respect to wastewater fed production of fishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![indicator](http://www.tandfonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/tandf/journals/content/tfls20/2016/tfls20.v009.i02/21553769.2016.1162753/20160621/images/medium/tfls_a_1162753_f0004_b.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phytoplankton\n",
    "\n",
    "Phytoplanktons, also known as microalgae, are similar to terrestrial plants in that they contain chlorophyll and require daylight to live and develop. Most are light and swim in the upper portion of the sea, where light infiltrates the water. Development and photosynthesis are closely related, each one being a function of usage of light and food supplements. Algae are quite sensitive to contamination, and this may be reflected in their population levels and/or rates or photosynthesis Affects development of population or photosynthesis, for the most part, algae are as sensitive to contaminations as other species. When there is change in the diversity of phytoplankton species, it may indicate pollution of the marine ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evidences pertaining to phytoplankton\n",
    "\n",
    "Phytoplanktons have been used for successful observation of water contamination and are a useful indicator of water quality. \n",
    "In 1975, Dugdale depicted the relationship of the growth rate of an algal population, photosynthesis, and nutrient concentration in the water body. Contaminations can influence the connection between rate of growth and each of these variables. For example, if there is an industrial effluent which is colored or contains suspended solids light may be filtered or absorbed causing a reduction in rate of growth. Macisaacand and Dugdale in 1976 showed that a decrease of light leads to decrease in rate of uptake of ammonia and nitrate in marine phytoplankton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overnell et al. demonstrated that light prompted oxygen evolution from the freshwater species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was sensitive to cadmium, methyl mercury, and lead. Moore et al. discovered that organo-chlorine compounds decrease use of bicarbonate by estuarine phytoplankton. Whitacre et al. also produced significant research on the effect of numerous chlorinated hydrocarbons on fixation of carbon by phytoplankton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phytoplanktons are also an important source of pollutant transfer from water to upper tropic levels and even to humans. Algae are unable to decompose the pesticides and are thus a link of transfer to herbivores when fed upon. Substances gathering and intake plays an important role in pollution dynamics of phytoplankton. If light is obstructed, it hampers the intake of ammonia and nitrate by aquatic phytoplankton as indicated by Mac Isaac and Dugdale, especially when the industrial colored or solid suspended waste accumulates on the water surface which results in reduction of growth rate, filtrations, and absorption of light.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Zooplanktons\n",
    "\n",
    "Zooplanktons are microscopic animals living near to the surface of the water body. They are poor swimmers, instead relying on tides and currents as a transport mechanism. They feed upon phytoplanktons, bacterioplanktons, or detritus (i.e. marine snow). Zooplanktons constitute a vital food source for fish. They also play an important role as Bioindicators and help to evaluate the level of water pollution. In freshwater communities, along with fish, they are the main food supplement to many other marine species.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are assumed to be a vital part in indicating water quality, eutrophication, and production of a freshwater body. In order to determine the status of a freshwater body it is necessary to measure seasonal variations and presence of zooplanktons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differing varieties of species, biomass diversity and wealth of zooplankton groups can be utilized to determine the strength of a biological system. The potential of zooplankton as a bioindicator species is high on the grounds that their development and conveyance are subject to some abiotic (e.g. temperature, saltiness, stratification, and pollutants) and biotic parameters (e.g. limitation of food, predation, and competition).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evidences pertaining to zooplanktons\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanical fermentation brought on a reduction in the quantity of species and changes in species strength, both of which were influenced as pH decreased from 7.0 to 3.8. Jha and Barat completed research on Lake Mirik, in Darjeeling, Himalayas, on zooplankton. This lake was polluted due to toxins let into the lake from outer sources resulting in a decreased pH in the lake and an increased acidity level. This was confirmed by the investigation of other physiochemical parameters and planktons. In this condition, cladocerans (Bosmina, Moina, and Daphnia) and copepods (Phyllodiaptomus and cylops the most extensive copepods) were found. This examination presumed that the lake cannot be utilized as a deficit for the supply of drinking water and these organisms served as a bioindicator to focus on the wellbeing of this oceanic body. As indicated by Siddiqi and Chandrasekhar, trichotria tetrat is could be utilized as contamination indicators as they were seen in the lake which was rich in phosphorus and other heavy metal particle. This species was obtained in the past in sewage-contaminated tanks. Phosphorous and metal particle as well as high aggregate alkanity, hardness, and high conductivity (130 ms m−1) of the lake water were restricting components for the development of zooplankton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zooplankton may be present in an extensive variety of ecological conditions. Yet disintegrated oxygen, temperature, salinity, pH, and other physicochemical parameters are restricting elements. The vicinity of three types of Brachionussp indicates that the lake is being eutrophicated and is naturally contaminated. There is variation in the population of copepods, seasonally in various water bodies present in different parts of India; the seasonal studies of zooplanktons showed that the zooplanktons’ density was highest in the rainy season, while it reduced in summers due to high temperatures. Copepods form the dominant group of all the zooplanktons, followed by Cladocera, rotifer, and Ostrocoda. Ultimately, zooplankton has been found to be excellent an Bioindicator to evaluate the contamination of anyoceanic bodies (saltwater).\n",

    "#### Average Global Sea Surface Temperature\n",
    "Sea surface temperature—the temperature of the water at the ocean surface—is an important physical attribute of the world’s oceans. The surface temperature of the world’s oceans varies mainly with latitude, with the warmest waters generally near the equator and the coldest waters in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As the oceans absorb more heat, sea surface temperature increases and the ocean circulation patterns that transport warm and cold water around the globe change.\n",
    "Changes in sea surface temperature can alter marine ecosystems in several ways. For example, variations in ocean temperature can affect what species of plants, animals, and microbes are present in a location, alter migration and breeding patterns, threaten sensitive ocean life such as corals, and change the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms such as “red tide.”Over the long term, increases in sea surface temperature could also reduce the circulation patterns that bring nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters. Changes in reef habitat and nutrient supply could dramatically alter ocean ecosystems and lead to declines in fish populations, which in turn could affect people who depend on fishing for food or jobs.\n",
    "Because the oceans continuously interact with the atmosphere, sea surface temperature can also have profound effects on global climate. Increases in sea surface temperature have led to an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor over the oceans. This water vapor feeds weather systems that produce precipitation, increasing the risk of heavy rain and snow (see the Heavy Precipitation and Tropical Cyclone Activity indicators). Changes in sea surface temperature can shift storm tracks, potentially contributing to droughts in some areas. Increases in sea surface temperature are also expected to lengthen the growth season for certain bacteria that can contaminate seafood and cause foodborne illnesses, thereby increasing the risk of health effects.\n",

    "#### Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change\n",
    "As the temperature of the Earth changes, so does sea level. Temperature and sea level are linked for two main reasons:\n",
    "Changes in the volume of water and ice on land (namely glaciers and ice sheets) can increase or decrease the volume of water in the ocean (see the Glaciers indicator).\n",
    "As water warms, it expands slightly—an effect that is cumulative over the entire depth of the oceans (see the Ocean Heat indicator).\n",
    "Changing sea levels can affect human activities in coastal areas. Rising sea level inundates low-lying wetlands and dry land, erodes shorelines, contributes to coastal flooding, and increases the flow of salt water into estuaries and nearby groundwater aquifers. Higher sea level also makes coastal infrastructure more vulnerable to damage from storms.\n",
    "The sea level changes that affect coastal systems involve more than just expanding oceans, however, because the Earth’s continents can also rise and fall relative to the oceans. Land can rise through processes such as sediment accumulation (the process that built the Mississippi River delta) and geological uplift (for example, as glaciers melt and the land below is no longer weighed down by heavy ice). In other areas, land can sink because of erosion, sediment compaction, natural subsidence (sinking due to geologic changes), groundwater withdrawal, or engineering projects that prevent rivers from naturally depositing sediments along their banks. Changes in ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream can also affect sea levels by pushing more water against some coastlines and pulling it away from others, raising or lowering sea levels accordingly.\n",
    "Scientists account for these types of changes by measuring sea level change in two different ways. Relative sea level change refers to how the height of the ocean rises or falls relative to the land at a particular location. In contrast, absolute sea level change refers to the height of the ocean surface above the center of the earth, without regard to whether nearby land is rising or falling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute sea level trends were provided by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These data are based on measurements collected by satellites and tide gauges. Relative sea level data are available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which publishes an interactive online map (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.shtml) with links to detailed data for each tide gauge.\n",
