## Plankton Challenge

SAP Labs France invites you to The Next Generation Challenge in collaboration with Oceanographic Observatory of Villefranche-sur-Mer - one of the world leading oceanographic research centres. 

The SAP Next-Gen program is an innovation platform for the SAP ecosystem enabling companies, partners and universities to connect and innovate with purpose linked to the UN Global Goals. Reimagine the future of industries with exponential technologies. Seed in disruptive innovation with startups. Build skills for digital futures. Showcase thought leadership.

The program leverages a network of 3,300+ educational institutions in 111 countries that are members of the SAP University Alliances and SAP Young Thinkers programs.

In this challenge we will try to tackle the SAP's global goal 14: Life Below Water, the aim of this goal is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.

The Oceanographic Observatory of Villefranche-sur-Mer  was established in 1882 by Hermann Fol with the encouragement of Charles Darwin and has a world-wide reputation in  plankton research and also is one of the most “Data Science” aware geo sciences research centres. The observatory has collected about 50 million images of plankton from all over the world with 20 million of them already labelled and ready for use.

Our Next Gen challenge will ask students to propose a prototype of a new application which will show practical usage of “plankton data” for general public or for industry, using the attributes of plankton images and plankton ability to predict water/air quality. The teams will be formed at the beginning of the challenge and will consist of the students from different schools representing different skills (business, data science, coding) and helped by SAP developers. The Design thinking sessions will start the teams off on a path of new and inventive applications! The data will be prepared for students for exploration.
